<h1>Sensor Block dApp</h1>

This is a private ethereum network dashboard that displays historical records of a vehicle
that belongs to either a manufacturer, a company or a person. This allows auditable and transparent
information regarding the purchase or transfer of a vehicle. To do that the blockchain keeps track
of all data sent by the car's sensors to an API, the API serves to the blockchain, and ultimately 
an API takes data from the blockhchain to either serve it to a Machine Learning module, or to display it
in this website using Web3.
